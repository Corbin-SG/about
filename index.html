        <!--About me line 1-->
        <h4 class = "text">I'm currently in between my first and second year at Conestoga's SET program. I hope to enter the co-op stream to gain work experience.
          After graduation, I plan to continue my education in university. My specific employment goals are still undecided other than I wish to use my software skills.

        <!--About me line 2-->
        <h4 class = "text">
            Since my childhood, I've wanted to create content. My definition of "content" has changed over the years but as of right now I hope to create stories.
            I want to write books, I want to create art for my stories, and I want to develop games around them. My skills are all very basic at the moment but each day
            I strive to improve them.
        </h4>

        <!--About me line 3-->
        <h4 class = "text">
            Outside of previously mentioned interests, I also enjoy music, shows, and a few games. I typically spend my free time playing games or watching shows.
            I've also been taking some time out of each day to learn other languages (mainly Dutch). I read a lot as a child but have struggled to make time for it as
            of late.
        </h4>

        <!--About me line 4-->
        <h4 class = "text">
            I grew up in Ontario and have not travelled much. The one big trip I took as a child was to Jamaica for a week. I hope to travel more in the future.
            I'm the eldest child with two younger brothers. We were moved schools a lot as a child (I went to three schools in one year once) but by middle school
            we were both in a consistent location. I tried many ways of using my creativity as a child but didn't stick with anything until I was in high school and
            finally managed to finish a piece of writing.
