        <h4 class = "text">
            I’m currently a first-year in the SET program at Conestoga College. I love programming and the other aspects of CS, but especially programming. I’m still 
            learning, but I know enough to have coded this site, so that’s something!

        <!--About me line 3-->
        <h4 class = "text">
            I also enjoy writing. I allowed the compliments from my English teachers to get to my head and pushed out a poorly written story in September 2022. I’m 
            working on a sequel that you will not have to read the first book to understand. (I fully intend to never look at the first one again.) Alongside writing, 
            I picked up drawing to create designs for my characters. I suck at it, but I’m getting better.

        <!--About me line 4-->
        <h4 class = "text">
            Besides my time-consuming hobbies, I occasionally play video games and watch shows. I currently consistently play Genshin Impact, Ensemble Stars, and 
            Project Sekai. (I’m a big fan of rhythm games.) My favourite shows are Dr. Stone, Bungo Stray Dogs, and Jujutsu Kaisen. (I swear I don’t only watch anime. 
            I’ve also seen shows like Brooklyn 99, Big Bang, The Witcher, and Grey’s Anatomy.)
