        <!--About me line 1-->
        <h4 class = "text">I'm currently in my fourth semester at Conestoga's SET program. I'm seeking a co-op placement for the Summer 2025 work term in order to hone my skills and contribute to real-world projects.
          After graduation, I currently plan to further my education through University.

        <!--About me line 2-->
        <h4 class = "text">
            Since my childhood, I've wanted to create content. My definition of "content" has changed over the years now, I enjoy developing programs.
            I love the process of building something from scratch and seeing everything come together, I love the first glimpse of your idea forming into reality. I want to experience
            that in my day-to-day life. I want to create software that makes a difference, that makes a positive impact on communities.
        </h4>

        <!--About me line 3-->
        <h4 class = "text">
            In my personal life, I also enjoy creation in other forms. I love to write and draw, I love stringing words together to form a story, to create characters with in depth personalities
            and relationships. Outside of creation, I enjoy music, video games, learning new languages, and spending time with my friends.
        </h4>

        <!--About me line 4-->
        <h4 class = "text">
            I grew up in Ontario and the eldest child with two younger brothers. I moved around a lot as a child and grew up to value communication, honesty, and hard work in my
            day-to-day life. I strive to improve on my life each day, whether that be building on my skills, working on a project, or making a new friend. I hope to continue improving
            into the future and inspire others to do the same.
